\section{Resonance Curves for 3 Different Damping Coefficients}

$Q_{1}=$
$Q_{2}=$
$Q_{3}=$

There was no way to observe a shift in $\omega_{2}$ from my data because the mass was changed in order to achieve three different resonance curves. However, if I had kept the mass consistent for each trial and instead changed the relative position of the magnet in the stack of weights, then I would have been able to see a shift in $\omega_{2}$.

\section{Measuring Q in Other Ways}

I was able to measure Q in other ways by starting the measurement with the frequency set to $0.600$ Hz and then unplugging the wave generator, and also by starting the measurement with the wave generator unplugged and set to 0.600 Hz.

\section{Measuring small incremental changes in glider mass}

Data was collected for the same glider five times, each time with a different number of 5 g masses (ranging from 0 to 4).
